## Action Items

### High Priority
1. **Branch Coverage**
   - Add test cases for complex conditional logic
   - Focus on edge cases in control flow
   - Test boundary conditions

2. **Function Coverage**
   - Implement missing function tests in TuneToken
   - Add tests for remaining MusicNFT functions
   - Ensure all public/external functions are tested

### Medium Priority
1. **Statement Coverage**
   - Improve TuneToken statement coverage
   - Add tests for complex operations
   - Cover error handling paths

2. **Line Coverage**
   - Target remaining uncovered lines
   - Focus on error conditions
   - Test modifier combinations

### Low Priority
1. **Documentation**
   - Document coverage improvements
   - Update test patterns
   - Maintain coverage reports

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Write additional branch coverage tests
   - Complete function test coverage
   - Document complex test scenarios
