# RecommendationGraph Contract Documentation

## Overview
RecommendationGraph implements a decentralized music recommendation system using a weighted graph structure. It tracks user interactions, generates personalized recommendations, and manages artist and track relationships.

## Features

### Graph Structure
- Weighted edges for relationships
- Dynamic weight adjustment
- Bidirectional connections
- Relationship scoring

### Recommendation Engine
- Personalized suggestions
- Interaction-based weights
- Genre clustering
- Similarity scoring

### Interaction Tracking
- User listening history
- Purchase patterns
- Engagement metrics
- Time-weighted scores

## Functions

### Graph Management

#### addTrackRelation
```solidity
function addTrackRelation(
    uint256 trackId1,
    uint256 trackId2,
    uint256 weight
) external
```
Adds or updates a relationship between two tracks.

#### updateWeight
```solidity
function updateWeight(
    uint256 trackId1,
    uint256 trackId2,
    uint256 newWeight
) external
```
Updates the weight of an existing relationship.

#### removeRelation
```solidity
function removeRelation(uint256 trackId1, uint256 trackId2) external
```
Removes a relationship between tracks.

### Recommendation Generation

#### getRecommendations
```solidity
function getRecommendations(
    uint256 trackId,
    uint256 limit
) external view returns (uint256[] memory)
```
Returns recommended tracks based on a given track.

#### getPersonalizedRecommendations
```solidity
function getPersonalizedRecommendations(
    address user,
    uint256 limit
) external view returns (uint256[] memory)
```
Returns personalized recommendations for a user.

### Interaction Recording

#### recordInteraction
```solidity
function recordInteraction(
    address user,
    uint256 trackId,
    InteractionType interactionType
) external
```
Records a user's interaction with a track.

## Events

```solidity
event RelationAdded(uint256 indexed trackId1, uint256 indexed trackId2, uint256 weight);
event WeightUpdated(uint256 indexed trackId1, uint256 indexed trackId2, uint256 newWeight);
event RelationRemoved(uint256 indexed trackId1, uint256 indexed trackId2);
event InteractionRecorded(address indexed user, uint256 indexed trackId, InteractionType indexed interactionType);
event RecommendationGenerated(address indexed user, uint256[] recommendations);
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**
   - Graph modification permissions
   - Weight update authorization
   - Interaction validation

2. **Data Integrity**
   - Weight bounds checking
   - Relationship validation
   - Interaction verification

3. **Operational Security**
   - Gas optimization
   - Storage efficiency
   - Computation limits

## Integration Guide

### Adding Track Relations
```solidity
// Add relationship between tracks
recommendationGraph.addTrackRelation(
    track1Id,
    track2Id,
    75 // weight out of 100
);
```

### Recording Interactions
```solidity
// Record user interaction
recommendationGraph.recordInteraction(
    userAddress,
    trackId,
    InteractionType.Listen
);
```

### Getting Recommendations
```solidity
// Get personalized recommendations
uint256[] memory recommendations = recommendationGraph.getPersonalizedRecommendations(
    userAddress,
    10 // limit
);
```
