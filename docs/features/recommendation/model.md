# TuneFi Decentralized Recommendation Graph Model

## Overview
TuneFi implements a fully decentralized recommendation system using a distributed graph model. Unlike traditional centralized recommendation engines, TuneFi's system operates entirely on-chain, leveraging smart contracts and decentralized storage to ensure transparency, censorship resistance, and user sovereignty over their data.

## Decentralized Architecture

### Core Principles
1. **Full Decentralization**
   - No central authority controlling recommendations
   - Community-driven curation and validation
   - Transparent, auditable recommendation logic
   - Permissionless participation

2. **Data Sovereignty**
   - User-controlled data storage
   - Opt-in data sharing
   - Local computation options
   - Self-sovereign identity integration

3. **Trustless Operation**
   - Smart contract-based validation
   - Proof-of-recommendation consensus
   - Decentralized oracle integration
   - Verifiable computation paths

### Distributed Storage
1. **IPFS Integration**
   - Metadata storage
   - Content addressing
   - Immutable history
   - Distributed availability

2. **Arweave Backup**
   - Permanent storage
   - Historical preservation
   - Proof of history
   - Data redundancy
