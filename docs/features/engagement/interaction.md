# Interaction System

## Overview
The TuneFi interaction system is a comprehensive framework that tracks, rewards, and gamifies user engagement with the platform. It creates a dynamic and rewarding experience by monitoring user actions, calculating engagement scores, and distributing rewards based on participation and achievement.

## User Actions

### 1. Content Interaction
Content interactions form the core of user engagement with the platform's music content:

**Track Plays**: When a user listens to a track, the system records:
- Play duration (minimum 30 seconds for valid play)
- Time of play
- User's listening context (playlist, direct, recommendation)

**Playlist Creation**: Users can curate music collections:
- Minimum 3 tracks required for valid playlist
- Genre tagging and description
- Public/private visibility settings
- Collaborative playlist options

**Content Sharing**: Amplifies music discovery through:
- Social media integrations
- Platform-native sharing
- Referral tracking
- Share impact measurement

**Comments and Reviews**: Encourages community feedback through:
- Track reviews (minimum 50 characters)
- Rating system (1-5 stars)
- Comment threading
- Moderation system

### 2. Social Interaction
Social features build community and enhance music discovery:

**Following Artists**: Creates direct connections:
- Artist updates in user feed
- Early access to releases
- Special fan rewards
- Engagement multipliers

**Community Participation**: Encourages active platform involvement:
- Forum discussions
- Genre communities
- Artist AMAs
- User-generated content

**Collaborative Playlists**: Enables community curation:
- Multi-user editing
- Voting on additions
- Activity feed
- Contribution tracking

### 3. Economic Interaction
Financial engagement mechanisms that drive platform value:

**NFT Purchases**: Primary market interactions:
- First releases
- Limited editions
- Bundle purchases
- Resale rights

**Token Staking**: Platform investment mechanism:
- Minimum stake periods
- Reward multipliers
- Governance rights
- Feature access levels

**Liquidity Provision**: Market making incentives:
- Trading pair creation
- Liquidity rewards
- Fee sharing
- Market stability roles

### 4. Platform Contribution
Community-driven platform improvement:

**Bug Reporting**: Quality assurance participation:
- Issue tracking system
- Severity classification
- Bounty rewards
- Resolution tracking

**Feature Suggestions**: Platform evolution input:
- Proposal system
- Community voting
- Implementation tracking
- Contributor recognition

## Reward Triggers

### 1. Action-Based Triggers
Rewards based on specific user actions:

**First-time Actions**:
```solidity
struct FirstTimeReward {
    bytes32 actionType;
    uint256 baseReward;
    uint256 bonusWindow;  // Time window for bonus rewards
    bool claimed;
}

function claimFirstTimeReward(bytes32 actionType) external {
    FirstTimeReward storage reward = firstTimeRewards[msg.sender][actionType];
    require(!reward.claimed, "Already claimed");
    
    uint256 amount = reward.baseReward;
    if (block.timestamp <= reward.bonusWindow) {
        amount += calculateBonus(actionType);
    }
    
    reward.claimed = true;
    distributeReward(msg.sender, amount);
}
```

**Milestone Achievements**:
Progression-based rewards that unlock at specific thresholds:
- Track play counts (100, 1000, 10000)
- Playlist followers (10, 100, 1000)
- Community contributions (10, 50, 100)
- Trading volume ($100, $1000, $10000)

**Streak Maintenance**:
Consistency rewards that encourage regular engagement:
- Daily login rewards (increasing with streak length)
- Weekly activity completion
- Monthly achievement targets
- Seasonal participation goals

### 2. Time-Based Triggers
Temporal engagement incentives:

**Daily Rewards**:
```solidity
struct DailyReward {
    uint256 lastClaim;
    uint256 consecutiveDays;
    uint256 totalClaims;
}

function claimDailyReward() external {
    DailyReward storage reward = dailyRewards[msg.sender];
    
    // Check if 24 hours have passed
    require(block.timestamp >= reward.lastClaim + 1 days, "Too soon");
    
    // Check if streak is maintained
    if (block.timestamp <= reward.lastClaim + 2 days) {
        reward.consecutiveDays++;
    } else {
        reward.consecutiveDays = 1;
    }
    
    uint256 amount = calculateDailyReward(reward.consecutiveDays);
    reward.lastClaim = block.timestamp;
    reward.totalClaims++;
    
    distributeReward(msg.sender, amount);
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Smart Contract Architecture
The interaction system is built on a modular contract architecture:

```solidity
contract InteractionSystem {
    // Core state variables
    mapping(address => UserProfile) public profiles;
    mapping(bytes32 => ActionConfig) public actions;
    mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => uint256)) public actionCounts;
    
    struct UserProfile {
        uint256 totalActions;
        uint256 engagementScore;
        uint256 lastAction;
        mapping(bytes32 => ActionState) actionStates;
    }
    
    struct ActionConfig {
        uint256 basePoints;
        uint256 cooldown;
        uint256 maxDaily;
        bool active;
    }
    
    struct ActionState {
        uint256 count;
        uint256 lastTimestamp;
        uint256 dailyCount;
        uint256 dailyReset;
    }
    
    // Core interaction logic
    function recordAction(
        address user,
        bytes32 actionType,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external {
        require(actions[actionType].active, "Action not configured");
        
        UserProfile storage profile = profiles[user];
        ActionState storage state = profile.actionStates[actionType];
        ActionConfig memory config = actions[actionType];
        
        // Validate action
        require(
            block.timestamp >= state.lastTimestamp + config.cooldown,
            "Action in cooldown"
        );
        
        // Update daily limits
        if (block.timestamp > state.dailyReset + 1 days) {
            state.dailyCount = 0;
            state.dailyReset = block.timestamp;
        }
        require(state.dailyCount < config.maxDaily, "Daily limit reached");
        
        // Record action
        state.count++;
        state.dailyCount++;
        state.lastTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        profile.totalActions++;
        
        // Calculate and update engagement score
        uint256 points = calculatePoints(actionType, data);
        profile.engagementScore += points;
        
        // Trigger rewards
        processRewards(user, actionType, points);
        
        emit ActionRecorded(user, actionType, points);
    }
}
```
